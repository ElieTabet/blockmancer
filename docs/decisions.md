# Decisions

Every rule of `.claude/doc/SPRINTS_6_7.md` (and its Sprint 5 cleanup) that needed reading, with the
reading chosen and why. Newest task last.

## Task 0: Sprint 5 cleanup

### 0a. Offer bias and the Deep Pockets fix

- **Rule:** confirm the engine's offer bias is unchanged (0.75 partner offer) and that the Deep
  Pockets fix was in the bot only.
- **Finding:** `lib/src/run/offers.dart` last changed in Sprint 4 (`e4ac916`), and
  `defaultConfig.partnerBias` is 0.75; a test now pins both on the shipped config
  (`run_test.dart`, "the shipped run keeps the brief's partner bias of 3 in 4"). The fix
  (`8c18e7b`) touched only `lib/src/bot/` and added `RngStream.botPicks`, a stream no rule draws
  from. Deep Pockets going from 4 to 8 pieces was a tuning (`cd90589`), not part of the fix.
- **`random` now:** takes one of the offers, each as likely, drawn from the bot-only stream of the
  run's seed, never "the first offer", which the partner bias fills three times in four.

### 0a. The bot's pick policy for Sprint 7

- **Rule:** SPRINTS_6_7 Task 6 says "build joker when offered, otherwise first offer".
- **Reading:** keep the bot as fixed in Sprint 5, whose fallback is any offer, seeded.
- **Why:** the same file says "use the bot exactly as fixed in Sprint 5"; the first slot is the
  partner of an owned joker three times in four, so "first offer" would chase pairs and inflate
  `random`, which is the bug Sprint 5 fixed.

### 0b. Collector

- **Rule:** Collector becomes "+1 mult per other joker owned"; if combo,collector's "boss win |
  pair done" is still above 45%, "+1 mult per 2 jokers owned" instead.
- **Result:** per other joker gave 59% in Rubble and 48% in Gravity (2,000 runs), above 45% in
  both, so Collector now adds `collectorMultPerJoker` for every two jokers owned, itself included
  (`jokerCount ~/ 2`): 28% in Rubble and 21% in Gravity. Owned alone it adds nothing and doesn't
  fire.
- **Reading:** "above 45%" was checked per world, and one world above was enough.
- **Side effect:** `random` beats the boss less (Rubble 24% to 16%, 56% to 41% once round 4 is
  cleared), since its picks include Collector; Task 0d measures it at 10,000 runs.
- **Saved runs:** a run saved before this build plays the new rule once resumed. Rules aren't
  versioned in the save (only their numbers are), and a mid-run save is rare enough not to warrant
  it.
